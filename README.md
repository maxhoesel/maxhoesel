### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a compsci student with an interest in DevOps processes, automation and configuration management. Most of my work relates to Linux and Ansible, but I also have some other projects you can take a loot at.

Check out [my website](https://maxhoesel.de/code-devops/) if you want to learn more.

Id you find my projects useful and would like to thank me, you can buy me a ~~beer~~coffe on Ko-Fi: https://ko-fi.com/maxhoesel

Hope you have a great day!
